Things still to do:

* Add support for other USB HID devices than Keyboard

* Split out keyboard functionality into keyboard-specific file with own keyboard object

* Decide whether to use internal 'worker' threads and if not, remove the existing one.

* Better use of testing framework

* Improve documentation
